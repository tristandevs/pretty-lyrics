# A New and More Pretty Spotify Lyrics Experience

## Karaoke Lyrics for EVERYONE
If you don't have Premium, Spotify won't give you any lyrics.

Pretty Lyrics provides Lyrics to _EVERYONE_ for **FREE**.
Pretty Lyrics supports **Karaoke**, _Line_, and Statically synced lyrics with
additional features like **Background Vocals** and **Side Vocals**.

## Fullscreen for EVERYONE
Did you know _Spotify doesn't give its fullscreen mode to non-premium users_?

With Pretty Lyrics **EVERYBODY** gets an extremely pretty **Fullscreen Mode** with all the great features that the other views give!

### New Lyric Views
Brand new **Page, Cinema, and Fullscreen Views** that replace Spotifys own
versions and help improve your immersion in the song you are listening to!

### Dynamic Backgrounds
A new Dynamic Background that beautifully blends the Cover-Art colors for the Sidebar, Page, and Cinema/Fullscreen Views

### Lyric Romanization
If you're a fan of **Chinese, Japanese, or Korean songs** but want to see the lyrics phonetically spelled than just toggle the **Romanization** feature! The toggle is *per supported language* so you can **pick and choose which ones are romanized**!

### Auto-Updates
Never worry about Updating ever! **Pretty Lyrics is ALWAYS Up-to-Date because it Auto-Updates as _SOON_ as an update is available!** This means that if you make an issue/suggestion - it could be added and working for you (and everyone else) minutes later!
